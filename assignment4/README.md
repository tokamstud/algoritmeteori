# Extended Fibonacci Series

for recursive O(2^n)

for dynamicc  O(n)


# Longest common subsequence

We can use bruteforce approach, that will find all the subsequences and find the longest one, but this requires exponential time for solving. ref [392] Introduction to Algorithms

By using dynamic we can save subproblems
