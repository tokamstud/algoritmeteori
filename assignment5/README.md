Prims algorithm is significantly than Kruskal's if the graph is really dense with many edges, more edges than vertices. Kruskal is better for sparse graphs, the main reason is because Kruskal is simpler uses simpler datastructures.

Kruskal's and Prim's MST algorithms work fine with negative edges.
